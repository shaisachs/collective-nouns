# collective-nouns

One of the things that is awesome about language is the many creative ways we have found to refer to collections of things.   For example:

* A stare of owls
* A blessing of unicorns
* A tower of giraffes
* A shuffle of bureaucrats

There are many more such examples, here: http://users.tinyonline.co.uk/gswithenbank/collnoun.htm

I believe there are many more collectives waiting to be minted!  Hence, this repository.

I've seeded collective-nouns.md with a few that occur to me.  By all means, please fork and contribute more.
