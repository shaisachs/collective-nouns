* A jump of kangaroos
* A screen of bug reports
* A flutter of tweets
* A buttering of scones
* A jolt of surge protectors
* A bracket of programmers
  * A code of programmers
  * A not of 0 programmers
* A clique of mice
* A turn of bicycles
* A gulp of forks
* A clatter of buckets
* A drop of umbrellas
* A tick of tasks
* A blot of signatures
* A flutter of books
* A grumble of pugs
